## 1. What is AutoCAD?
AutoCAD is commonly used across various industries such as engineering, architecture, drafting, and design. The primary goal is to create precise 2D and 3D (not covered in this course) drawings that enable communication, documentation, and collaboration in modelling information within and across disciplines. Some people argue that AutoCAD is a dinosaur of software that professionals like designers and construction project managers rarely use anymore. However, **drafting 2D information in AutoCAD is still common because you can't create a 3D model without a base plan!** In other words, AutoCAD remains a useful tool to create the foundation for more advanced modelling or drafting work, especially in the 3D environment. Besides, because of its long-standing presence in the market, **many of the drafting principles in the 3D environment are based on the workflow of AutoCAD.** Therefore, by achieving a sound foundation in the software, you will be able to pick up other computer-aided design software at a much faster rate.

## 2. Why and when do we use AutoCAD?
AutoCAD has been extensively used in the construction. There are applications in other industries and the following are examples of why and when it is used,
